# Contributing Guide

Contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps and credit will always be given.

## Setting up your environment

After forking enzyme to your own github org, do the following steps to get started:

```bash
# clone your fork to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/iclinic/html2pdf.git

# step into local repo
cd html2pdf

# install dependencies
npm install   // If you're using npm
yarn          // If you're using yarn
```

## Pull request guidelines

Before you submit a pull request from your forked repo, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated as part of the same PR.
2. Please rebase and resolve all conflicts before submitting.
